# C Dev

This repository contains casual C programs, libraries and projects developed by me.

*Note:- The code used in the development may not be the best way of doing things. The code used is just my casual work.*

## Help

More details about the projects are discussed in their respective *'README.md'* file. For more detail about the individual code file take a look at the comments.
