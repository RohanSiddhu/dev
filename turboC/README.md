# turboC

This repository contains the C/C++ codes.
Codes were coded for turboC4 compiler while I was learning C from 'Let us C' by Yashavant P. Kanetkar.
Most of the codes are from the exercise of 'Let us C'.

*Note - These codes may not be the best way of doing things done as these were written when I was learning.
